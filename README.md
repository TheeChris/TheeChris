<p style="font-size:20px;">Hi, I’m Chris Lynch :wave:</p>

<p style="font-size:35px">I'm a data scientist working in the government sector (public health and health care)</p>

- 👀 I’m interested in improving public and health services through data-driven products, systems optimization, and good old fashioned statistical analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to integrate [mlflow](https://mlflow.org/) into our data science workflow.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects for the greater good.
- :coffee: When I'm not coding, you can find me hanging out with my family, gardening, drawing, messing with circuits, woodworking, and still playing guitar poorly after all these years
